# brunch.TO

If you're a mildly basic torontonian who enjoys pourovers with oat milk or frequents dive bars on queen west, you're likely also looking for some last-minute brunch inspo when you forget to call 2 weeks in advance to book a reservation at that other place.<br/>

You can search for any brunch restaurant in Toronto by name or keyword, or by all restaurants at highest rated/lowest cost. <br/>
You can save places to checkout later in your brunch bucket list. <br/>
